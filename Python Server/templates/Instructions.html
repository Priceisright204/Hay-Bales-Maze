        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><span style='mso-fareast-font-family: "Times New Roman"'>A hay-bales maze is an open maze without walls. Instead of turning where you would like, you must continue straight until you hit a wall. Follow the grid lines closely. In this computer version, the lines are tracked for you. When you hit a wall, you may turn depending on what walls are around you.</span></p>

    <h1><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>About Hay-Bales Mazes</span></h1>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><span style='mso-fareast-font-family: "Times New Roman"'>The &#8216;hay-bales&#8217; maze is a favorite childhood invention of mine. It feels more like a corn maze: <span class=GramE>you&#8217;re</span>never quite sure where you&#8217;re going to end up! You can be on one side of the maze in one moment and on the other side in the next. </span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><span style='mso-fareast-font-family: "Times New Roman"'>I say it was a childhood invention, but it is clearly an adult game. A hay-bales maze is more difficult than a regular maze and takes more time to solve. It is like a puzzle. A hay-bales maze is to a regular maze as Sudoku is to counting on your fingers.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><span style='mso-fareast-font-family: "Times New Roman"'>I first thought of the idea after visiting Mount Vernon (George Washington&#8217;s home) as a child. At the plantation, there was a maze set up using hay bales. It was like a corn maze, except the <span class=GramE>hay</span> bales were short and you could see where you were going. There was a catch: you <span class=GramE>were only allowed</span> to turn when you hit a wall. Otherwise, you were required <span class=GramE>to always continue</span> straight. After hitting a wall, you <span class=GramE>were allowed</span> to choose which way to turn. The maze was difficult. I saw some children running through it doing what they wanted to and not following the simple maze rules. Some people would give up after trying for a minute, expecting a simple maze. I made it through, but it required me to explore a bit and to repeat my paths a few times.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><span style='mso-fareast-font-family: "Times New Roman"'>The maze fascinated me. It dawned on me that this maze could easily be recreated using graph paper in the same way that a corn maze could be &#8216;drawn&#8217; on regular paper. I created the system of walls and turns that you see in my maze here. I also added a &#8216;permeable&#8217; wall where you can also choose to go forward, just to make things more interesting.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><span style='mso-fareast-font-family: "Times New Roman"'>I started drawing &#8216;hay-bales&#8217; mazes on graph paper and showing my friends. I saw the same result with the graph paper as I had seen in the maze at Mount Vernon: most people did not expect a complicated puzzle and would only spend a minute on it.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><span style='mso-fareast-font-family: "Times New Roman"'>Thus I have created a digital version of a Hay-Bales maze that makes it easier to make choices and easier to stay in-line on the graph paper. I think it is more fun this way, too, because you can see your line progressing on the <span class=GramE>page</span> (I would not let people draw lines on my mazes).</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><span style='mso-fareast-font-family: "Times New Roman"'>Here is a sample maze I made in 2013 on graph paper. As you can see, I digitized it on a computer. I have been making these since middle school!</span></p>
